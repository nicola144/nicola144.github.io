## About

I am a Master's student in the [School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics).
As undergrad, I studied Computer Science at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/). 
The current title of my degree is technically "Artificial Intelligence", but I don't think it is a word that particularly well represents its actual content. [This](https://medium.com/@mijordan3/artificial-intelligence-the-revolution-hasnt-happened-yet-5e1d5812e1e7) blogpost well summarizes something I'd agree with on this whole AI fanatism.
