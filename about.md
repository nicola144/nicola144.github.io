## About

I am a Master's student in the [School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics).
As undergrad, I studied Computer Science at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/). 
I am broadly interested in Bayesian inference, applied (or not) to Machine Learning. 


# Great books
