# Improved Auxiliary Particle Filters

In this post, my aims are: 
* Introduce Bayesian inference in state space models
* Introduce approximate inference using importance sampling, in state space models
* Finally, describe the Auxiliary Particle Filter, its intepretation and the recent Improved Particle Filter by Elvira et al. [1]

The ideal target reader has familiarity with Bayesian inference, basics of Monte Carlo and importance sampling, basics of particle filters. However, if you are familiar with Bayesian inference in a "batch" setting (where data is processed all at once), you should be able to follow. If you are not, I will write a blogpost on Bayesian inference that assumes no prior background except basic rules of probability. Even then, I ambitiously hope that this post can be interesting to both Bayesian statistics experts who aren't aware of the work I will describe (these can skip to the sections on Auxiliary Particle Filters and Improved Auxiliary Particle Filters.) *and* people who see particle filters for the first time. Ah, knowing some CS may help too.

## Brief introduction to sequential inference <a name="introduction"></a>

In Bayesian inference we want to update our beliefs on the state of some random variables, which could represent parameters of a parametric statistical model or represent some unobserved data generating process. Focussing on the "updating" perspective, the step to using Bayesian methods to represent dynamical systems is quite natural. The field of statistical signal processing has been using the rule of probabilities to model object tracking, navigation and even.. spread of infectious diseases. 
The probabilistic evolution of a dynamical system is often called a *state space model*. This is just an abstraction of how we think the state of the system evolves over time. Imagine we are tracking a robot's position (x,y coordinates) and bearing: these constitute a 3 element vector. At some specific timestep, we can have a belief, i.e. a probability distribution that represents how likely we think the robot is currently assuming a certain bearing etc. If we start with a prior, and define some likelihood function/ sampling process that we believe generates what we observe, we can update our belief over the system's state with the rules of probabilty.
Let the (uknown) state of the system at time $t$ be the vector valued random variable $\mathbf{s}_{t}$.

We observe this state through a (noisy) measurement $\mathbf{v}_{t}$ (where v stands for visible). 

Now we have to start making more assumptions. What does our belief on $\mathbf{s}_{t}$ depend on ? 

Suprisingly to me, it turns out for **a lot** of applications it just needs to depend on the state at the previous timestep. 
In other words, we can say that $$\mathbf{s}_{t}$$ is sampled from some density $$f$$ conditional on $$\mathbf{s}_{t-1}$$:

$$
\color{blue}{\text{Transition density}}: \qquad \mathbf{s}_{t} \sim \color{blue}{f}(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) \tag{1}\label{eq1}
$$

Further, usually the observation or visible is sampled according to the current state:

$$
\color{green}{\text{Observation density}}: \mathbf{v}_{t} \sim \color{green}{g}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t}) \tag{2}\label{eq2}
$$

It is reasonable to assume this: if we take a measurement, we don't expect its outcome to be dependent on previous states of the system, just the current one ($$\color{blue}{f}$$ and $$\color{green}{g}$$ seem arbitrary but they are common in the literature). For example, a classic Gaussian likelihood for would imply that the belief over $$\mathbf{v}_{t}$$ is a Normal with a mean being a linear combination of the state's coordinates.

These collection of random variables and densities define the state space model completely. It is worth, if you see this for the first time, reflecting on the particular assumptions we are making. How the belief on $\mathbf{s}$ evolves with time could depend on many previous states; the measurement could depend on previous measurements, if we had a sensor that degrades over time, etc... I am not great at giving practical examples, but if you are reading this, you should be able to see that this can be generalized in several ways. 
Note that a lot of the structure comes from assuming some variables are statistically independent from others. The field of probabilistic graphical models is dedicated to representing statistical independencies in the form of graphs (nodes and edges). One benefit of the graphical representation is that it makes immediately clear how flexible we could be. 

In short, when the transition density and the observation densities are linear combination of their inputs with additive, i.i.d. Gaussian noise, then the state space model is often called a Linear Dynamical System (LDS). When variables are discrete, it is often called Hidden Markov Model (HMM). These are just labels. 

There are several tasks that we can perform on the state space model described above. Each of these has a fancy name, but you should recall that technically all we are doing is applying the sum and product rules. These tasks are just associated to a *target* distribution which is the object of interest that we want to compute. Let's list some of these: 

<p>
  <b>Filtering</b>: The target distributions are of the form: $p\left(\mathbf{s}_{t} | \mathbf{v}_{1: t}\right), \quad t=1, \ldots, T$. This represents what we have learnt about the system's state at time $t$, after observations up to $t$.<br>

  <b>Smoothing</b>:  The target distributions are of the form: $p\left(\mathbf{s}_{t} | \mathbf{v}_{1: T}\right), \quad t=1, \ldots, T$. This represent what we have learnt about the system's state after observing the *complete* sequence of measurements, and revised the previous beliefs obtained by filtering. <br>

<b>Parameter Estimation</b>: The target distributions are of the form: $p\left(\boldsymbol{\theta} | \mathbf{v}_{1: T}\right)= \int p\left(\mathbf{s}_{0: T}, \boldsymbol{\theta} | \mathbf{v}_{1: T}\right) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s}_{0: T}$. The parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ represent all the parameters of any parametric densities in the state space model. In the case that the transition and/or observation densities are parametric, and parameters are unknown, we can learn them from data by choosing those that both explain the observations well and also agree with our prior beliefs. Parameter estimation is sometimes referred to as *learning*, because parameters describe properties of sensors that can be estimated from data with machine learning methods. So, it is called learning just because it is cool. <br>

### General Bayesian Filtering <a name="sub1"></a>

#### Some notation
- The notation $$\mathbf{v}_{1:t}$$ means a collection of vectors $$ \left \{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_t \right \}$$
- Therefore, $$ p\left ( \mathbf{v}_{1:t} \right )$$ is a joint distribution: $$p\left ( \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_t \right ) $$
- Integrating $$ \int p(\mathbf{x}_{1:t}) \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}_{i:j}$$ means $$ \underbrace{\int \dots \int}_{j-i+1} p(\mathbf{x}_{1:t}) \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}_{i} \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}_{i+1} \dots \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}_{j} $$

In this post, I am only concerned with filtering, and will always assume that any parameters of <span style="color:blue">transition</span> or <span style="color:green">observation</span> densities are known in advance. 
Let's derive how to find the filtering distribution in the state space model described without many assumption on the densities.
Recall that the aim is to compute: $$ p\left(\mathbf{s}_{t} | \mathbf{v}_{1: t}\right)$$. Apply Bayes rule:  

$$
\require{cancel}
p\left(\mathbf{s}_{t} | \mathbf{v}_{1:t}\right) = \frac{ \overbrace{p \left( \mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t}, \cancel{\mathbf{v}_{1:t-1}} \right )}^{\mathbf{v}_t ~ \text{only dep. on} ~ \mathbf{s}_t} p\left( \mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1} \right ) }{p\left( \mathbf{v}_t \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1} \right )} = \frac{  \color{green}{g}\left( \mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t} \right ) p\left( \mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1} \right ) }{p\left( \mathbf{v}_t \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1} \right )} \tag{3}\label{eq3}
$$

If this equation is confusing, think of the previous measurements $$\mathbf{v}_{1:t-1}$$ as just a "context", that is always on the conditioning side, a required "input" to all densities involved, with Bayes rule being applied to $$\mathbf{s}_{t}$$ and $$\mathbf{v}_{t}$$.
We know the current measurements only depends on the state, therefore $$p \left( \mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1} \right ) = p \left( \mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t} \right ) = \color{green}{g}( \mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t} )$$, and only the right term in the numerator is left to compute. This term is a marginal of $$ \mathbf{s}_t$$, which means we have to integrate out anything else. If we were doing this very naively, each time we would integrate out all previous states, but by caching results a.k.a. Dynamic Programming, we only need to marginalize the previous state: 

$$
  p\left( \mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1} \right ) = \int p\left( \mathbf{s}_{t}, \mathbf{s}_{t-1} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1} \right ) \mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}_{t-1}
$$

Continuing, we split the joint with the product rule and exploit remember that the states are independent of previous measurements:

$$
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
  &= \int p\left( \mathbf{s}_{t} \mid  \mathbf{s}_{t-1}, \cancel{\mathbf{v}_{1:t-1}} \right ) p(\mathbf{s}_{t-1} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1}) \mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}_{t-1} \\
  &= \int p\left( \mathbf{s}_{t} \mid  \mathbf{s}_{t-1} \right ) p(\mathbf{s}_{t-1} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1}) \mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}_{t-1} \\
  &= \int \color{blue}{f}\left( \mathbf{s}_{t} \mid  \mathbf{s}_{t-1} \right ) p(\mathbf{s}_{t-1} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1}) \mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}_{t-1}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{4}\label{eq4}$$


And we are done, if you notice that the right side term in the integral is the filtering distribution at $$t-1$$, which we have already computed. 
In the literature names are given to the step that requires computing $$ p\left( \mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1} \right )$$ called *prediction*, because it's our belief on $$ \mathbf{s}_{t}$$ before observing the currrent measurement, and *correction* is the name given to the step $$ p\left(\mathbf{s}_{t} | \mathbf{v}_{1:t}\right) \propto \color{green}{g}\left( \mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t} \right ) \cdot p\left( \mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1} \right )$$, because we "correct" our prediction by taking into account the measurement. 

In a LDS, all computations have closed form solutions, and this algorithm instantiates into the *Kalman Filter*. For discrete  valued random variables, if the dimensionalities are small we can also do exact computations and the label this time is *Forward-Backward* algorithm for HMMs. 
When variables are non-Gaussian and/or transition/observation densities are nonlinear function of their inputs, we have to perform approximate inference. 
By far the most popular method is to use Monte Carlo approximations, and more specifically importance sampling. When we use importance sampling to approximate the filtering distribution, this is called *particle filtering*. 

### Recursive formulations <a name="sub2"></a>

Note that most *particle* filtering methods, which we will describe later, actually do not compute the filtering distribution with the correction and prediction steps. Instead, they express the filtering distribution by finding recursive relationships. Here, we show how this view is equivalent to the one just presented. The calculations will be instructive to understand particle filtering later. Consider the sequential estimation of a different distribution to the filtering, namely: 

$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) \propto p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) 
\end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{5}\label{eq5}$$

Let's take its unnormalized version for simplicity. Applying Bayes' rule gives the following recursive relationship:

$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) = p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1}) \color{blue}{f}(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) \color{green}{g}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t}) 
\end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{6}\label{eq6}$$

If you can't see why this holds, consider this simple example/subcase: 

$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
p(\mathbf{s}_{1}, \mathbf{s}_{2}, \mathbf{v}_{1}, \mathbf{v}_{2}) = p(\mathbf{s}_{1}, \mathbf{v}_{1}) \color{blue}{f}(\mathbf{s}_{2} \mid \mathbf{s}_{1}) \color{green}{g}(\mathbf{v}_{2} \mid \mathbf{s}_{2})
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$

Hopefully this convinces you that \eqref{eq6} is true. Then, let's return to the task of sequentially estimating $$p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t})$$: 


$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) &= \frac{p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t})}{p(\mathbf{v}_{1:t})} \\
&= \frac{p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1}) \color{blue}{f}(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) \color{green}{g}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t})}{p(\mathbf{v}_{1:t})} \\ 
&= \frac{p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1})}{p(\mathbf{v}_{1:t-1})} \frac{\color{blue}{f}(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) \color{green}{g}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t})}{p(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1})} \\
&= p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1}) \frac{\color{blue}{f}(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) \color{green}{g}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t})}{p(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1})}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{7}\label{eq7}$$

Now that we've gone through all this, we are ready to show how to get the filtering distribution by simple marginalization of the expression we just found: 

$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
p(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) &= \int p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s}_{1:t-1} \\
&= \int p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1}) \frac{\color{blue}{f}(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) \color{green}{g}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t})}{p(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1})} \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}\\
&= \frac{\color{green}{g}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t})}{p(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1})} \int p(\mathbf{s}_{1:\color{red}{t-1}} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1}) \color{blue}{f}(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s}_{1:t-1} \\
&= \frac{\color{green}{g}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t})}{p(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1})} \overbrace{\int p(\mathbf{s}_{1:\color{red}{t}} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}}^{= p(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1}) ~ \text{by marginalization}} \\
&= \frac{p(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1}) \color{green}{g}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t})}{p(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1})} 
\end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{8}\label{eq8}$$

Which is the indeed same result that we got through the prediction and correction steps. 

## Particle filtering <a name="paragraph1"></a> 

In real-world settings, we need approximate inference. Specifically in the filtering/sequential Bayes literature, importance sampling based methods are more popular than deterministic approximations such as Laplace's method, Variational Bayes and Expectation Propagation. 
Recall that the Monte Carlo method is a general tool to approximate integrals, expectations, probabilities with random samples: 

$$
\mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{x})}[f(\mathbf{x})] = \int f(\mathbf{x}) p(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x} \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} f(\mathbf{x}_{n}) \qquad \mathbf{x}_n \sim p(\mathbf{x})
\tag{9}\label{eq9}$$

Where $$f(\mathbf{x})$$ is some generic function of $$\mathbf{x}$$. Monte Carlo approximations of this kind are very appealing since unbiased and consistent, and it is easy to show that the variance of the estimate is $$ \mathcal{O}(n^{-1})$$ *regardless* of the dimensionality of the vector $$\mathbf{x}$$. Another simple idea that we will use extensively in particle filtering is that these samples can not only be used to approximate integrals with respect to the target distribution $$p(\mathbf{x})$$, but also to approximate the target itself:

$$
p(\mathbf{x}) \approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N} \delta_{\mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{x}_{n})
$$

Where $$  \delta_{\mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{x}_{n})$$ is the Dirac delta mass evaluated at point $$\mathbf{x}_{n}$$. 
Often it is not possible to sample from the distribution of interest. Therefore we can use importance sampling, which is a technique based on the following simple observation:

$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{x})}[f(\mathbf{x})] &= \int f(\mathbf{x}) \cdot p(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x} \\
&= \int \frac{f(\mathbf{x}) \cdot p(\mathbf{x})}{q(\mathbf{x})} \cdot q(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \\
&= \mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{x})} \left [ f(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \frac{p(\mathbf{x})}{q(\mathbf{x})} \right ]
\end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{10}\label{eq10}$$

Under certain conditions, namely that $$ f(\mathbf{x}) \cdot p(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \Rightarrow q(\mathbf{x}) > 0$$, we have rewritten the expectation under a distribution of choice $$q(\mathbf{x})$$c alled *proposal* which we can sample from. Note that it is not possible to have $$ q(\mathbf{x}) = 0$$, as we will never sample any $$\mathbf{x}_{i}$$ from $$q$$ such that this holds. 
Let's return in the context of Bayesian inference, where we have a target posterior distribution $$ \pi(\mathbf{x}) = p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathcal{D}) $$ where $$ \mathcal{D}$$ is any observed data. For example, in state space models $$\mathcal{D} = \mathbf{v}_{1:t}$$. Consider an integral of some function of $$ \mathbf{x}$$ under the posterior: 

$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{I} = \mathbb{E}_{\pi(\mathbf{x})}[f(\mathbf{x})] = \int f(\mathbf{x}) \pi(\mathbf{x}) 
\end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{11}\label{eq11}$$

Note that we can estimate this integral in two main ways with importance sampling: the former which assumes that we know the normalizing constant of the posterior $$ \pi(\mathbf{x})$$, and the latter estimates the normalizing constant too by importance sampling, with the same set of samples. Let's examine the latter option:

$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}_{\pi} \left [ f(\mathbf{x}) \right ] &= \int f(\mathbf{x}) \pi(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \\
&= \int  f(\mathbf{x})\frac{\pi(\mathbf{x})}{q(\mathbf{x})} q(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \\
&= \int  f(\mathbf{x})\frac{p(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{D})}{p(\mathcal{D})q(\mathbf{x})} q(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \\
&=  \frac{1}{p(\mathcal{D})}\int  f(\mathbf{x})\frac{p(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{D})}{q(\mathbf{x})} q(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \\
&=  \frac{1}{\int p(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{D}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x}}\int  f(\mathbf{x})\frac{p(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{D})}{q(\mathbf{x})} q(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \\
&=  \frac{1}{\int \frac{p(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{D})}{q(\mathbf{x})}  q(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x}}\int  f(\mathbf{x})\frac{p(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{D})}{q(\mathbf{x})} q(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} \\
&= \frac{1}{\mathbb{E}_{q}\left [ \frac{p(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{D})}{q(\mathbf{x})} \right ]}
\cdot \mathbb{E}_{q}\left [ f(\mathbf{x}) \frac{p(\mathbf{x}, \mathcal{D})}{q(\mathbf{x})} \right ] \\
&\approx \frac{1}{\cancel{\frac{1}{N}}\sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{p(\mathbf{x}_i , \mathcal{D})}{q(\mathbf{x}_i)}}
\cdot ~ \cancel{\frac{1}{N}} \sum_{n=1}^{N} f(\mathbf{x}_i) \frac{p(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathcal{D})}{q(\mathbf{x}_i)} 
\end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{12}\label{eq12}$$


### Sequential Importance Sampling

Let us now go back to the task of sequentially estimating a distribution of the form $$ \left \{ p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) \right \}$$. This time however, we estimate any distribution by a set of weighted samples, a.k.a particles. 
First I am going to explain necessary notation. Note that the treatment in this section is very general and not specific to any particular state space model (hence not to the first order Markov one described earlier).  

* Let $$\gamma_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t})$$ be the "target" distribution at time $$t$$ for states $$\mathbf{s}_{1:t}$$. Always keep track of all indices. For example, $$\gamma_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1})$$ is a different object, namely $$\int \gamma_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s}_t $$. It is also different of course from $$\gamma_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t})$$, which is just the target at $$t-1$$. Importantly, note that the usual "target" is **the unnormalized version** of whatever our distribution of interest is ($$ p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t})$$ or $$p(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) $$.

So, let's suppose then that we are trying to find a particle approximation for our target $$\gamma_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t})$$. We can use importance sampling directly with a proposal distribution that also depends on $$\mathbf{s}_{1:t}$$ and find the  (unnormalized) importance weights: 

$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\tilde{w}_{t} = \frac{\gamma_t(\mathbf{s}_{1:t})}{\color{#FF8000}{q}_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t})}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{13}\label{eq13}$$

With these , we can build the self-normalized importance sampling estimator as we have seen in the previous section. Recalling that all distributions we are dealing with are actually just a set of (possibly weighted particles), we can then approximate the target by replacing the proposal with its particle approximation in \eqref{eq13}: 

$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\gamma_t(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}) \approx \frac{1}{N}\cdot \sum_{n=1}^{N} w_{t}^{n} \delta_{\mathbf{s}_{1:t}}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}^{n})
\end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{14}\label{eq14}$$

where $$w_{t}^{n}$$ are the normalized weights, and we are using $$N$$ samples for our proposal. 
So how is this different to non sequential importance sampling? The problem is that without explicitly stating any assumptions/constraints on the proposal these calculations scale linearly with the dimension of the state space $$t$$. Let's see how it is possible to avoid this by simply imposing a simple autoregressive (time series jargon) structure on the proposal. 
Let our new proposal at time $$t$$ be the product of two factors: 

$$
q_{t}\left(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}\right)=q_{t-1}\left(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}\right) q_{t}\left(\mathbf{s}_{t} | \mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}\right)
$$

We can now exploit this proposal structure to express the weights at time $$t$$ as a product between the previous weights at $$t-1$$ with a factor. The algebraic trick uses multiplying and dividing by the target at $$t-1$$ to artificially obtain the weights at $$t-1$$:

$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
 \tilde{w}_{t}\left(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}\right) &=\frac{\gamma_{t}\left(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}\right)}{\color{#FF8000}{q}_{t}\left(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}\right)} \\ &=\frac{1}{\color{#FF8000}{q}_{t-1}\left(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}\right)} \frac{\gamma_{t-1}\left(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}\right)}{\gamma_{t-1}\left(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}\right)} \frac{\gamma_{t}\left(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}\right)}{\color{#FF8000}{q}_{t}\left(\mathbf{s}_{t} | \mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}\right)} \\ &=\frac{\gamma_{t-1}\left(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}\right)}{\color{#FF8000}{q}_{t-1}\left(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}\right)} \frac{\gamma_{t}\left(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}\right)}{\gamma_{t-1}\left(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}\right) \color{#FF8000}{q}_{t}\left(\mathbf{s}_{t} | \mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}\right)} \\
 &= \tilde{w}_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}) \cdot \frac{\gamma_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t})}{\gamma_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}) \color{#FF8000}{q}_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{t}\mid \mathbf{s}_{1:t-1})}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{15}\label{eq15}$$

Therefore, we can approximate our desired distribution as:

$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) \approx \frac{1}{N}\cdot \sum_{n=1}^{N} w_{t}^{n} \delta_{\mathbf{s}_{1:t}}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}^{n})
\end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{16}\label{eq16}$$

with the weights $$w_{t}^{n}$$ defined as the normalized weights found in \eqref{eq15}.
This is the essence of SIS (Sequential Importance Sampling). Important note: this is a standard presentation you can find e.g. in [2]. However, you should note that for example, if we put this into context of state space models say, then the proposal can depend on measurements too. Crucially, although it would be natural to split it as: $$ q_{t}\left(\mathbf{s}_{1:t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t}\right)=q_{t-1}\left(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:\color{red}{t-1}}\right) q_{t}\left(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}, \mathbf{v}_{1:\color{red}{t}}\right)$$ this is usually a *choice*, we could make both terms dependent on the current measurements or even more generally all data that is available at time $$t$$ ! We will come back to this when discussing the Auxiliary Particle Filter. 
Ok, now it's time to apply SIS to the state space model we covered earlier. In this context, what we want is $$\left \{ p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) \right \} $$ , hence our target $$\gamma$$ is the unnormalized posterior: $$\gamma_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}) := p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t})$$. Now the recursion that we developed earlier in the post for the joint $$ p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t})$$ becomes useful in deriving the weight update for SIS: 

$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\tilde{w}_t &= \tilde{w}_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}) \cdot \frac{\gamma_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t})}{\gamma_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}) q_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{t}\mid \mathbf{s}_{1:t-1})} \\
&=  \tilde{w}_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}) \cdot \frac{\color{blue}{f}(\mathbf{s}_{t}\mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) \color{green}{g}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t}) \overbrace{p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1})}^{\cancel{\gamma_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1})}}}{\cancel{\gamma_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1})} q(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{1:t-1})} \\
&= \tilde{w}_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}) \cdot \frac{\color{blue}{f}(\mathbf{s}_{t}\mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) \color{green}{g}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t})}{q(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{1:t-1})}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{17}\label{eq17}$$$$

If you are given a choice for the proposal $$q(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}) $$, then you have a concrete algorithm to sequentially approximate $$\left \{ p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) \right \}_{t \geq 1}$$, with constant time per update (remembering that throughout the algorithm only uses unnormalized weights, and only when one wants to approximate the desired distribution one has to normalize the weights). This algorithm is neat, but suffers from  

## The Auxiliary Particle Filter and its interpretations <a name="paragraph2"></a>

In this interpretation of the APF, the motivation is as follows. In SMC , if we had acces to the optimal proposal $$ p(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{t}, \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) $$ (which minimizes the variance of the weights) , then the multiplicative update to the weights becomes an expression that *does not* depend on the current state $$\mathbf{s}_{t}$$. Therefore, it is possible to *interchange the order* of the sampling and resampling steps. Intuitively, this yields a better approximation of the distribution as it provides a greater
number of distinct particles to approximate the target. This is an example of a general principle: resampling,
if it is to be applied in a particular iteration, should be performed before, rather than after, any operation
that doesn’t influence the importance weights in order to minimise the loss of information. However, in general the incremental importance weights do depend upon the new states and this straightforward change of order becomes impossible. *In a sense, this interchange of sampling and resampling produces an algorithm in which information from the next observation is used to determine which particles should survive resampling at a given time*. It is desirable to
find methods for making use of this future information in a more general setting, so that we can obtain the
same advantage in situations in which it is not possible to make use of the optimal proposal distribution. 

This is how we motivate wanting to use $$\mathbf{v}_{t+1}$$ in APF. It is shown that APF can be reinterpreted as a standard SMC algorithm that uses a different target distribution.
In the APF we want to make use of $$ \mathbf{v}_{t+1}$$ and thus set the target $$\gamma_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}) = p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}, \mathbf{v}_{1:\color{red}{t+1}})$$. By expanding this we can express it as:

$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\gamma_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}) := p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t} , \mathbf{v}_{\color{red}{t+1}}) &= \int p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t+1} , \mathbf{v}_{1:t+1}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s}_{t+1} \\
&= \int p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t} , \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) \cdot {\color{blue}{f}}(\mathbf{s}_{t+1} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t}) \cdot {\color{green}{g}}(\mathbf{v}_{t+1} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t+1}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s}_{t+1} \\
&=  p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t} , \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) \int {\color{blue}{f}}(\mathbf{s}_{t+1} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t}) \cdot {\color{green}{g}}(\mathbf{v}_{t+1} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t+1}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s}_{t+1} \\
&=  p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t} , \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) \cdot \underbrace{p(\mathbf{v}_{t+1} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t})}_{"predictive~likelihood"}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{18}\label{eq18}$$

Where if the predictive likelihood $$p(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1})$$ is replaced with an approximation $$\hat{p}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1})$$ if not known analytically. 
Therefore in APF the weight update becomes: 

$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
&= W_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}) \cdot \frac{\gamma_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t})}{\gamma_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}) q_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{t}\mid \mathbf{s}_{1:t-1})} \\
&=  W_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}) \cdot  \frac{p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) \hat{p}(\mathbf{v}_{t+1} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t})}{p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1}) \hat{p}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) q(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{1:t-1})} \\
&= W_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}) \cdot \frac{\cancel{p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1})} \color{blue}{f}(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) \color{green}{g}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t}) \hat{p}(\mathbf{v}_{t+1} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t})}{\cancel{p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1})} \hat{p}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) q(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{1:t-1})} 
\end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{19}\label{eq19}$$

since we have a different target $$ \gamma_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t})$$ to the unnormalized filtering $$p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t})$$, the algorithm actually sequentially estimates $$\left \{ \hat{p}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t+1}) = p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) \hat{p}(\mathbf{v}_{t+1} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t}) \right \}_{t \geq 1} $$ , therefore we need to use importance sampling to obtain $$\left \{ p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) \propto p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) \right \}_{t \geq 1}$$, with the following importance distribution:

$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\hat{p}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1} , \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) q_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{t}, \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) = p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1}) \hat{p}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) q_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{t}, \mathbf{s}_{t-1})
\end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{20}\label{eq20}$$

So that the weight update becomes (what we actually want divided by proposal):

$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
&= W_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}) \cdot  \frac{p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t})}{\hat{p}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1} , \mathbf{v}_{1:t}) q_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{t}, \mathbf{s}_{t-1})} \\
&= W_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}) \cdot  \frac{p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t})}{ p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1}) \hat{p}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) q_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{t}, \mathbf{s}_{t-1})}  \\
&=  W_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}) \cdot \frac{\cancel{p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1})}f(\mathbf{s}_{t}\mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) g(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t})}{\cancel{p(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}, \mathbf{v}_{1:t-1})}\hat{p}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) q_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{t}, \mathbf{s}_{t-1})} \\
&= W_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}) \cdot \frac{f(\mathbf{s}_{t}\mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) g(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t})}{\hat{p}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) q_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{t}, \mathbf{s}_{t-1})}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{21}\label{eq21}$$ 

Selecting $$q_t(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}) =  p(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{t}, \mathbf{s}_{t-1})$$ and $$\hat{p}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) = p(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1})$$
leads to the so called "perfect adaptation" . 
Setting the approximation to the predictive likelihood (the true is equal to $$ p(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) = \int {\color{blue}{f}}(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) \cdot {\color{green}{g}}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s}_{t} $$) to $$\hat{p}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) = g(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}(\mathbf{s}_{t-1})) $$ where $$ \boldsymbol{\mu}(\mathbf{s}_{t-1})$$ is some likely value is common. For example , if we choose as approximation to the predictive likelihood : $$\hat{p}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) = g(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{t-1}) $$  where $$\boldsymbol{\mu}_{t-1}$$ is the mean of $$ f(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) $$ *and* we also choose $$ q_t(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{t}, \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) = f(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1})$$ , then we recover as special case the popular version of the APF weights: 

$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
&= W_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}) \cdot \frac{f(\mathbf{s}_{t}\mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) g(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t})}{\hat{p}(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1}) q_{t}(\mathbf{s}_{t} \mid \mathbf{v}_{t}, \mathbf{s}_{t-1})} \\
&= W_{t-1}(\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1}) \cdot \frac{\cancel{f(\mathbf{s}_{t}\mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1})} g(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \mathbf{s}_{t})}{g(\mathbf{v}_{t} \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}_{t-1}) \cancel{f(\mathbf{s}_{t}\mid \mathbf{s}_{t-1})}}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{22}\label{eq22}$$
